# Ayushman Choudhury

Hello! I'm a junior at Brown University (Class of 2025), studying Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Music.

I'm currently finding myself at home with Python, R, and MATLAB, but I have prior experience in Java, C/C++, SQL, Angular (HTML/CSS/TypeScript). My long-term goal is to apply my love of mathematical puzzles, aided by modern computational power, to help communities and society at large.

Currently looking for summer internships or research opportunities!
